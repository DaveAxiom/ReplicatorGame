# ReplicatorGame

ReplicatorGame is based on a computer game that goes under alternative slang and inappropriate names. It is simple to play and the computer AI isn't too difficult after you get the hang of play.

## Rules

The rules are as follows: 
* Goal: To control more than 50% of the board by the end of the game. 

* Setup: Two player, turn-based game played on a square board (normally around 15x15). Player 1 has a piece at the top-left. The AI has a piece in the bottom-right corner of the board.

* Movement: You move one piece at a time. You can either move it one space or two spaces. If one space is moved, the cell will reproduce (thus a piece will reside in both the original and new position). If you move the piece two spaces, the piece jumps to the new position. The game stops when all spaces are taken, or it is impossible for the current player to move. 

* Captures: When a piece moves into a position, it will take control of all adjacent enemy pieces.
